Here is an example of a process of making a customer for a website that I am working on. The diagram I made is split up in different characters with every character having each their own role. The diagram shows not only the best outcome, but also the other possibilities at some cases. That is what it makes it a progress.

### What are the core processes in software development?

The planning and analysis of requirements is the first step in software development. Documenting the criteria and schedule in a structured way is one of the next tasks. Following the completion of the documentation, the application is designed and prototyped, followed by the real development process. Testing and deployment are critical stages that take place either during the development cycle or at the end of each module.
