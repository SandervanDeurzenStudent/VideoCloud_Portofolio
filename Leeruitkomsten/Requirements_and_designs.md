We had a good idea of what the client expected from us after our first meeting with our stakeholder World of Content. Our team began building user stories based on the criteria. We ranked the user stories in order of importance. Before we began development, we created concepts, models, and designs. We took extra time with each return every three weeks to ask more questions, examine our user stories and future plans, and noticeably change our planning and notes in response to our interactions with World of Content.

For my IP, I decided to make user stories out of the requirements I set up. I created the user stories so that it is more readable to people outside software development. As you can see below, on the right are the requirements and on the left are the User-stories
