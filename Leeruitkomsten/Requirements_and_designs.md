**_Clarification:_**
**_Multiple types of test techniques: You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance._**



After our first interview with our stakeholder World of Content,  we had an understanding of what the client expects from us. Our group started writing user stories connected to the requirements. We prioritized the user stories by importance. We made concepts, models and designs before we started the development. With every comeback every 3 weeks, we took our time to ask more questions, review our user stories and plans for the future, and noticably tweaked our planning and notes in accordance to the conversations we held with World of Content.

For my IP, I decided to make user stories out of the requirements I set up. I created the user stories so that it is more readable to people outside software development. As you can see below, on the right are the requirements and on the left are the User-stories
