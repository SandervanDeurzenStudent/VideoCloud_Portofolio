To work as efficient as possible in our group, we made sure to keep our proces and tasks on a scrumboard. We used a trelloboard to help us with that as you can see below.

Our user stories that we set up this project consist out of multiple properties. As you can see below the user story contains a timestamp, labels, checklists and members connected to it. This way we can see well-organized what the user stories are and which tasks everyone is working on.
