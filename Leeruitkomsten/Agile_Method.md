## What is Scrum and how did we use it in our group?
***"Agile methods or Agile processes generally promote a disciplined project management process that encourages frequent inspection and adaptation, a leadership philosophy that encourages teamwork, self-organization and accountability, a set of engineering best practices intended to allow for rapid delivery of high-quality software, and a business approach that aligns development with customer needs and company goals."***

To work as efficient as possible in our group, we made sure to keep our proces and tasks on a scrumboard. It keeps an overview over te tasks and the project. We used a  [trelloboard](https://trello.com/b/Q4D0RcQU/proftaak-semester-3) as tool to help us make the scrumboard.

Our user stories that we set up this project consist out of multiple properties. As you can see below the user story contains a timestamp, labels, checklists and members connected to it. This way we can see well-organized what the user stories are and which tasks everyone is working on.

### Pros and cond about agile:
**What Are the Benefits of Agile?**
Some of the known benefits of an agile project are:

- Faster software development life cycle
- Predictable schedule in sprints
- Customer-focused approach, resulting in increased customer satisfaction
- Flexible in accepting changes
- Empowers teams to manage projects
- Promotes efficient communications
- Ideal for projects with non-fixed funding

**What Are the Disadvantages of Agile?**
The following are disadvantages of agile:

- Agile requires a high degree of customer involvement, which not all customers are comfortable with or prefer to give.
- Agile assumes every project team member is completely dedicated, without which weakens the principle of self-management.
- A time-boxed approach may not be enough to accommodate all deliverables, which will require changes in priority and additional sprints that can bring up cost.


## Difference between the scrum method and waterfall method.

One of the most important differences between Waterfall and Agile is that Agile is an incremental and iterative approach; Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach. In agile there is more easily space for expansion.
some other mayor differences between agile and waterfall go as follows(according to [project_managment.com])(https://project-management.com/agile-vs-waterfall/#differences):

- Agile separates a project into sprints; Waterfall divides a project into phases.
- Agile helps complete many small projects; Waterfall helps complete one single project.
- Agile introduces a product mindset with a focus on customer satisfaction; Waterfall focuses on successful project delivery.
- Requirements are prepared everyday in Agile, while requirements are prepared once at the start in Waterfall.
- Agile allows requirement changes at any time; Waterfall avoids scope changes once the project starts.
- Testing is performed concurrently with development in Agile; testing phase comes only after the build phase in a Waterfall project.
- Test teams in Agile can take part in requirements change; test teams in Waterfall do not get involved in requirements change
