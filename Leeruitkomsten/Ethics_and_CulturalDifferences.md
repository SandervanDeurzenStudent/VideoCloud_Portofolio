## 5.1. Ethics

As a software engineer, you need to be aware of all the ethical aspects, principles, and practices within the field. You should make sure your software meets accessibility standards, Among other things, it should respect a user's privacy and be secure. 
To accomplish this, you have to critically evaluate your software design throughout the entire development process, Starting with an ethically sound design and adjusting it as needed. I have done research on this subject and performed an ethical analysis of my group project and individual project in order to increase my proficiency at this learing outcome.

### Why are ethics important in software engineering?
Ethics are important in software engineering because the software that an engineer writes has the potential to be used by large groups of people and might have a significant impact on their lives. As a software engineer you have to be aware and mindful of these possible consequences as you envision, develop and deploy your software. Not all consequences can be foreseen but you should feel responsible for attempting to ensure that your software does not cause harmful effects but instead benefits the people who use it.


<i>With the help of the TICT tool, my project-group and I have brainstormed about the possibilities on applying certain ethical subjects within our project.</i>

### As a software engineer, how can you address ethical issues in your work?
As a software engineer you need to be aware of the different ethical aspects, principles, and practices within the field. You should ensure that your software meets accessibility standards, that it respects a user's privacy, that it is secure, and all the other aspects as mentioned earlier in this document. In order to achieve this you have to critically evaluate your software design in all stages of its development, starting off with an ethically sound design and adjust it when necessary. Test and review your software frequently to see if it still meets your ethical requirements. Request user feedback and see if their needs are being met, and collaborate with them to improve your software.

### How do you know your ethical considerations are in line with those of other software engineers?
It's a good idea to discuss ethical considerations when starting a new software project, as well as when welcoming a new member to the team, to ensure that your ethical considerations align with those of other software engineers like your colleagues. Ask your coworkers about their thoughts on the subject and which ethical aspects are most important to them. A good way to stay up-to-date is to read articles (on the internet) and attend conferences about software development.

### What is my experience with ethics in my projects?

As we began developing our group project for World of Content, we as a team have taken into account several of the ethical aspects discussed above. The application is designed and developed to help fulfil the need that a lot of people have to meet with others that have similar interests and organize events where activities related to these interests can be performed. 

As an example, In the group project we are working on, we made sure the password of the user data gets hashed as soon as he enters the submit button. This is because we tried to be as safe and secure with the user data as possible. 
On another project I have made in the 2nd semester, we got an issue with storing confidential user data pictures on a 3rd party website(a storage place that we have no management over). To made sure it satisfies tot the clients ethical needs, we made sure to store it locally.

## 5.2. Cultural differences

As a software engineer you will meet all types of different people all over the world with all different types of different cultural standarts. This can lead to conflicts between you and the people you are working with/for. It is therefore important to be aware of these differences so that these intercultural collaborations may proceed smoothly.


During the course of my life I have had very few to none encounters with people from different countries and cultures. Some of these interactions have been in a personal setting while others involved collaboration in an educational setting. I have done research about what cultural differences are and how it effect businesses that I would like to share below.


### what is culture?

> Culture is the characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people, encompassing language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts.

### How does culture affect Businesses?
>It's important to note that culture affects nearly all aspects of business communication. Some of the most noticeable influences involve the formality and mediums used in business communications, but a business's organizational culture can shape and mold nearly every aspect of its communication.

  ### My experience with cultural differences in project groups.
  
Even though I don't got much experience working with other cultures in my group, I understand that communication is one of the most important aspects in differences When working with people with other cultures in groups. I enjoy working with less talkative people since I am a particularly talkative person, I like to stimulate other people to keep going and talk to people who are shy or not talkative. I found out about myself that I like to take the lead in project because of my initiative in projects. I have no problem with people who are less initiative in projects because I get the role to stimulate them.
