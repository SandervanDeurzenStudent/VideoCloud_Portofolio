# introduction
In this project, I want to create an online platform where users can listen to media from other users and upload media themselves. This media will be music only. The goal is to use this to demonstrate that I can show that I understand how a JavaScript front-end works, that I can combine this with an OO based back-end language and that the software is distributed so that it can satisfy a large amount of users. To make this process as fast and efficient as possible for the user, asynchronous communication will be used to avoid a long wait for a user. Combined with an intuitive UX, this should ensure that the user experience of the website is as optimal as possible. The user's data will be stored in a relational database. Since this is sensitive information, various security options will need to be considered to protect the user's data. 

# Learning outcomes


1. You design and build **user-friendly**, **full-stack** web applications.

2. You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.

3. You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project.

4. You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.

5. You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.

6. You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques.

7. You analyze and describe simple business processes that are related to your project.

8. You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.

### Git flow

In my project I use the git flow in my source control. The workflow is great for a release-based software workflow.

Branches:

- A main branch is created
- A develop branch is created from main
- Feature branches are created from develop
- When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch using Pull Request
- Closing the used feature branch
- When the development branch is done it is merged into main using Pull Request
