# Learning Outcomes
Below are the learning outcomes that I will cover in this project. I also desribe how I accomplished this.

## 1. Web application

_User friendly: You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques._

_Full-stack: You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (Javascript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g. Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues._
